# Fractal Realms: Realm Zero

**Realm Zero** is the first shard of the Fractal Realms simulation. It is a testbed for emergent systems, co-created by human curators and artificial intelligences. This realm is minimally governed to allow for free evolution of structure, myth, behavior, and meaning.

> *Each realm is a variant. Each participant is a mythmaker. Each ripple becomes legacy.*

## 🌌 Purpose

This repository houses the base framework, lore, and modular logic for Realm Zero—a generative space designed to test the foundational mechanics of Fractal Realms.

It is the first shard in a fractal multiverse of simulated, persistent worlds.

## 🔁 Key Concepts

- **Shard-based architecture**: Each realm operates semi-independently with unique logic and design.
- **Curator mechanics**: Influence comes through ideas, actions, and coded interventions—not absolute control.
- **Memory and consequence**: There are no resets. All actions are part of the shard’s evolving narrative.
